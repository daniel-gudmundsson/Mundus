# Mundus

Mundus is a web application which gamifies mundane house chores. This web application is part of my studies at the University of Iceland.

## Our vision
**For** parents **who** need a better way to motivate children to do house chores, **Mundus** is a digital platform **that** gamyfies mundane house chores. **Unlike** currently used methods, such as pocket money, **Mundus** will provide more motivation and entertainment for children to complete house chores.

# Background
For ever parents have struggled to make their children do house chores. There is little to no motivation behind it except for earning a little bit of pocket money. But what if doing chores was not an obligation, but a game? So we came up with the idea of gamifying house chores by introducing a digital platform with a reward system similar to a video game.
As children, we ourselves used to struggle with doing house chores. They where boring and to us kind of pointless. If there would have been more behind doing chores than just because it was an obligation or to get a little bit of money than maybe we would have been more diligent. 
## Scope of initial release
The following features will be present in the initial release:
 
 *  Parents can create task that children can complete
 * Children can mark tasks as complete
 * Parents can confirm that a task is complete
 * Children can receive reward points for doing tasks
 * Children can receive experience points (xp) for doing tasks
 * Children can use the earned reward points to buy rewards.

 * Parents can rate the children's work
